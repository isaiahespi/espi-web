Some of the links listed on that page are dead. I actually didn’t realize that Awesome R list of resources existed until…today (August 2023). So everything below are links to books I found on my own as I was struggling and hyper-fixating on the wrong things. “IF ONLY SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME, GUIDED ME” I say to myself as I perpetuate the ruthless cycle.\nMany of these books are commonly known, some are better than others. I have yet to organize this list into coherent categories. Right now, there’s a mix of content here which ranges from\nAll of this stuff overlaps to some extent, so current organization is fickle. I haven’t read through most of these, but neither have you so whatever."
