I have not curated this yet to be organized into different methods.\n\npsyTeachR\n\nThis resource is incredible. Just check it out.\n“The psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Neuroscience has successfully made the transition to teaching reproducible research using R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Our curriculum now emphasizes essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports. Students learn about probability and inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.”\n“This website contains our open materials for teaching reproducible research. See our GitHub for open data and code.”\n\nGrowth Curve Modeling\nGraphical & Latent Variable Modeling\n\nPretty good intro/information on Structural Equation Modeling (e.g., latent variable modeling) by Michael Clark (I don’t know him).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/rescaling-variables-to-be-same/)\n- [] (https://www.thoughtco.com/index-for-research-3026543)\n (https://www.thoughtco.com/cluster-analysis-3026694)\n\n\n (https://www.poliscidata.com/pages/rDemosResources.php?chapter=14)- [] (https://www.poliscidata.com/pages/rDemosResources.php?chapter=8)\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
